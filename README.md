# Camo

Camo stands for `Camouflage`. It’s a small menu bar app for macOS that allows you to quickly hide or show the files on your desktop. It’s useful if you have a client meeting or presentation where the mess of your desktop is exposed to people you want to impress.

There’s also a compiled version of Camo **[available here](https://ixeau.com/downloads/camo.zip)**.
